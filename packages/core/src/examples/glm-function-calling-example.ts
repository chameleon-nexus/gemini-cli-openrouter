/**
 * GLM function calling usage example
 * Demonstrates how to use the enhanced GlmContentGenerator for function calling
 */

// This example is temporarily kept as an empty file. GlmContentGenerator has been decoupled from CoreToolScheduler,
// and tool execution logic is uniformly handled in CoreToolScheduler. For examples and documentation, please refer to FUNCTION_CALLING.md.
